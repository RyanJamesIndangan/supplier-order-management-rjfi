## Files:

| File | Offers | Warning |
|------|--------|---------|
| `enterprise-catalog-500-items.csv` | 500 | ⚠️ Uses ~500 Gemini API calls! |

## Expected:
- Processing time: 5-15 minutes
- Dashboard stays responsive (performance optimization)
- Shows system can handle enterprise volumes

## ⚠️ Warning:
Only use this if demonstrating scalability. Uses many API calls (expensive on free tier).
