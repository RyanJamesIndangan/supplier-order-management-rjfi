**Updated**: October 24, 2025  
**Location**: `public/procurement.html`

## 🎯 What Changed

### **Before** ❌
- Used browser `confirm()` dialogs (ugly, outdated)
- Used browser `alert()` for results (limited formatting)
- **Always** auto-rejected other offers (no choice)
- Limited information before decision
- Poor user experience

### **After** ✅
- Beautiful custom modal dialogs
- Professional UI with smooth animations
- **Optional** auto-rejection (user choice!)
- Detailed analysis before decision
- Results displayed in organized modal
- CSP-compliant (no inline handlers)
- Better UX with loading states

---

## 📋 Features

### **1. Decision Modal**
When you click "🤖 AI Auto-Decide All":

**Shows You:**
- 📊 Number of products with pending offers
- 📊 Total pending offers count
- 📊 How many will be auto-accepted

**Gives You Options:**
- ✅ Accept best offers (always enabled)
- ❌ **Optional**: Auto-reject other offers
  - **Checked** (default): Auto-rejects non-best offers
  - **Unchecked**: Leaves other offers as "Pending" for manual review

**Example Use Case:**
- You want AI to pick the best, but want to manually review the others before rejecting
- You can uncheck "Auto-Reject" and review alternatives later

---

### **2. Results Modal**
After processing, shows:

**Summary Statistics:**
- ✅ Offers Accepted (green)
- ❌ Offers Rejected (red, if auto-reject enabled)
- ⏸️ Offers Left Pending (orange, if auto-reject disabled)

**Detailed Decisions:**
- Scrollable list of all decisions made
- Product name, supplier, action taken
- Clear visual indicators (✅ ❌ ⏸️)

---

## 🎨 UI Improvements

### **Modal Features:**
- ✨ Smooth slide-in animation
- 🌫️ Backdrop blur effect
- ❌ Multiple ways to close:
  - Click X button
  - Click "Cancel" button
  - Click outside modal
  - ESC key (future enhancement)

### **Styling:**
- Professional gradient buttons
- Hover effects and transitions
- Color-coded statistics
- Responsive design (works on mobile)
- Clean, modern appearance

---

## 🛡️ CSP Compliance

**All event handlers are CSP-compliant:**
```javascript
// ✅ GOOD: Event listeners in script
document.getElementById('confirmAiDecide').addEventListener('click', executeAiAutoDecide);

// ❌ BAD: Inline handlers (removed)
<button onclick="executeAiAutoDecide()">...</button>
```

**No violations:**
- ✅ No inline `onclick` handlers
- ✅ No inline `onload` handlers
- ✅ No inline `style` attributes with events
- ✅ Works in strict CSP environments

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **New Functions:**
1. `openModal(modalId)` - Shows modal
2. `closeModal(modalId)` - Hides modal
3. `showAiDecideModal()` - Opens decision modal with analysis
4. `executeAiAutoDecide()` - Performs the auto-decide logic

### **Event Listeners:**
```javascript
// AI Decide Modal
'closeAiDecideModal' → closeModal('aiDecideModal')
'cancelAiDecide' → closeModal('aiDecideModal')
'confirmAiDecide' → executeAiAutoDecide()

// Results Modal
'closeResultsModal' → closeModal('resultsModal')
'closeResultsBtn' → closeModal('resultsModal')

// Click outside to close
modal.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
  if (e.target === modal) closeModal()
})
```
